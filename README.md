**Project Alert: Add to Cart Feature Implementation**

**Project Title:** Add to Cart Functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Overview:**
I have successfully implemented an "Add to Cart" feature for an e-commerce website using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The feature allows users to select products and add them to their shopping cart, providing an interactive and seamless shopping experience.

**Key Features:**

- **HTML Structure:** 
  - Product listing page displaying items with titles, images, descriptions, and prices.
  - Each product has an “Add to Cart” button that triggers the addition of the item to the shopping cart.

- **CSS Styling:** 
  - The cart and product items are styled to be visually appealing and responsive.
  - Clear differentiation between product details and cart items.
  - The design is mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience on all devices.

- **JavaScript Functionality:**
  - The "Add to Cart" button dynamically adds selected products to the cart.
  - The cart updates in real-time, displaying the added items, total count, and price.
  - The cart can be viewed or hidden through a button toggle, providing users with better control.

**Technical Details:**
- The JavaScript utilizes arrays and objects to store product data and cart items.
- Event listeners are used to track user actions such as adding products to the cart.
- Simple DOM manipulation techniques update the cart's display dynamically.

**Outcome:**
The project successfully demonstrates how to create an interactive and functional "Add to Cart" feature. It can be further extended by integrating with a backend to handle payments, user authentication, and real-time stock management.

This project serves as a fundamental step in building e-commerce functionalities and enhancing user experience on websites.
